# cpp module 00
This module is about simple basic stuff about c++  
[Back to Repo README](../README.md)
## ex00
just simple program with class. Nothing special here.
### usage
1. run command `make` inside ex00 directory -> this will create executable called `megaphone`
2. run executable with arguments that you want in uppercase. For example: `./megaphone "Hej this is very stupid program"`

## ex01 
Another simple program that can store up to 8. Yes 8 contacts. But that is not all, they are also completely lost after executing program so you need to store them again when you restart it. Sorry
### usage
1. run command `make` inside ex01 directory -> this will create executable called `phone`
2. run executable like `./phone`

After executable is running there is 3 commands that are in infinite loop and user can run
- `ADD` -> save a new contact
- `SEARCH` ->  display a specific contact
- `EXIT` -> The program quits and the contacts are lost forever!
