## ex00
Small program in which I implement simple class and used class methods
### usage
1. run command `make` inside ex00 directory -> this will create executable called `BraiiiiiiinnnzzzZ`
2. run executable like: `./BraiiiiiiinnnzzzZ `

## ex01 
Same as ex00 with one more function
### usage
1. run command `make` inside ex01 directory -> this will create executable called `Moar_brainz\! `
2. run executable like: `./Moar_brainz\!  `

## ex02
Learning about references and pointers
### usage
1. run command `make` inside ex02 directory -> this will create executable called `brain `
2. run executable like: `./brain`


## ex03
Classs that use another class
### usage
1. run command `make` inside ex03 directory -> this will create executable called `unnecessary_violence`

## ex04
Program that takes 3 parameteres: filename, s1, s2. It will open \<filename> and copies it content in \<filename>.replace where all s1 will be replaced by s2
### usage
1. run command `make` inside ex03 directory -> this will create executable called `sed_is_for_losers`
2. run executable like: `./sed_is_for_losers <filename> <oldString> <newString>`.
