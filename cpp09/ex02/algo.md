i) Make pairwise comparisons of l n / 2 J disjoint pairs of elements. (If n is odd,
	leave one element out.)
ii) Sort the ln/2J larger numbers, found in step (i), by merge insertion.

iii) Name the elements a1, a2, ... , aln/2J, b1, b2, ... , bln/21 as in (1), where a1 <
	a2 ::::; · · · ::::; aln/2J and bi ::::; ai for 1 ::::; i ::::; l n/2 J; call b1 and the a's the
	"main chain." Insert the remaining b's into the main chain, using binary
	insertion, in the following order, leaving out all bj for j > r n/21: 


b are inserting using BinaryInsertion
